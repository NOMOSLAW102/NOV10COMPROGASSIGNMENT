I am Marc Gabriel R. Santos, currently studyng in UST, taking up Electronics Engineering. I am originally from Sta. Barbara, Pangasinan 
but we moved to Canlubang, Laguna when I was 12 years old because my father was reassigned to another company plant in Manila. 
My Father's name is Sadi Peralta Santos, and my mother's name is Maria Liliosa Rapsing Santos, and I love them. 
I have a girlfriend, and we've been together for nearly 7 years. She is studying in UP baguio, taking up Computer Science. I love her too.
I'll get my degree by 2022 and they will be proud of me.
